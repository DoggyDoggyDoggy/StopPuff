        "Choose a specific quit moment and carry on vaping normally until then—don’t pre-wean yourself, as this only heightens the device’s perceived value",
        "Remind yourself that vaping offers no real benefits—only addiction—and that giving it up brings gains in health, energy, money, and self-respect",
        "Make a solemn vow after your last vape that you will never take nicotine again—this resolution is crucial for long-term success",
        "Physical nicotine withdrawal is mild and short-lived; reframe any discomfort as your body healing rather than craving",
        "Don’t avoid vapers or smokers—enjoy social occasions and confidently say, “No thanks, I don’t vape,” knowing they’ll envy your freedom",
        "Instead of fighting thoughts of vaping, celebrate them (“Yippee, I don’t want to vape anymore!”) and they’ll lose power",
        "Understand that one slip is really just restarting the whole addiction cycle—never rationalise a single “social” vape",
        "Patches, gums, nasal sprays, and e-cigarettes perpetuate the illusion of sacrifice and keep the addiction alive",
        "Dispose of every vape and cartridge to eliminate temptation and reinforce your status as a non-vaper",
        "Whenever you feel a fleeting urge, remind yourself that returning to vaping means re-enslaving yourself—choose freedom instead",
